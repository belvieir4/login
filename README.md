# Simple login

A simple login that I designed back in 2020 while working as a Product Designer, it has the hability to change to a "forget password" screen within the same page.

It was built **using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript**.

You can check the [original layout here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GxyKDmsbgQlVgn20N3JwSb_Frf9PUcHI/view?usp=sharing)
